# 📚 DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning repository! This repo contains my progress, practice problems, code solutions, and notes as I work through different DSA concepts.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- **`code/`**: Contains all the DSA code implementations.
- **`problems/`**: Solved practice problems from various platforms.
- **`notes/`**: Personal notes and explanations on data structures and algorithms.
- **`projects/`**: Larger projects that apply DSA concepts in real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Goals

- Learn and implement key data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Solve algorithmic challenges (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Build a strong foundation for competitive programming and coding interviews.

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Python**: Primary language for solving problems and implementing algorithms.
- **Git**: Used for version control and tracking progress.
- **Markdown**: For creating notes and documentation.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

I'll be updating this repository with new solutions and notes as I advance in my DSA journey. You can track my learning progress here and see the approaches I use for solving different challenges.

## 🤝 Contributing
